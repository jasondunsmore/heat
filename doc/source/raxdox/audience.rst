Intended Audience
=================
This guide is intended to assist support teams, DevOps Engineers, and
software developers who want to develop templates for use on the Cloud
Orchestration Service. This service is intended to automate tasks in a manner
that will speed deployment and provide a method that allows users to deploy a
complete application instead of having to manually deploy individual resources.
This will remove barriers that have historically prevented customers from
deploying resources in the Rackspace Cloud.

To use the information provided here, you should first have a general
understanding of the Cloud Orchestration service. You should also be familiar
with:

- Software deployments
- Software installations on server infrastructure
- Infrastructure components such as Cloud Load Balancers and Cloud Databases
- JSON and/or YAML data serialization formats
